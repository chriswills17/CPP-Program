# CPP-Program
Project 3 for SNHU Course CS-210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project here was tasked with reading a txt file for grocery tracking purposes. The primary purpose here was to combine both C++ and Python together to create a functional tracking program.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I am getting better at ensuring in-line comments describe each aspect of the code well. This will help ensure others viewing the code don't have to guess at its function.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I tried to initially implement different color selection for different parts of the code, but haven't managed to figure that out quite yet. This would help have the program seem more dynamic for the user.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Writing code that reads and write files is still challenging to me, so this gave me a little bit of trouble. I used previous course materials still accessable to me, as well as online resources such as Stack Overflow. These will continue to be utilized in my resources.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Definitely seeing that multiple languages can be combined to utilize the benefits of each of their use cases will assist me in the future. Gaining a better understanding of the pros and cons to each language will help me choose the proper language(s) for future projects.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Going back to in-line comments, this helps in its readability. This will also help in adaptability, as coders know what each particular function does and can modify them without having to guess on their purpose.
